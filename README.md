# Video Hosting Application

This project is an assessment task for creating a basic video hosting application. The primary goal was to build an Android application that can read a dataset (in the form of a zip file) from storage, create necessary directories, and process video and metadata files.

## Features

- **Read File from Storage**: The application allows users to select a zip file from their device storage.
- **Create Directory**: The application creates necessary directories to store the unzipped files.
- **Process Files**: Intended to unzip the selected file and process the contained videos and metadata.

### Challenges Faced

- **Unzipping Files**: I encountered significant challenges in unzipping the selected file. Despite multiple attempts and troubleshooting, I was unable to fully implement the unzip functionality within the given timeframe.

- ## Acknowledgements
  
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assessment. I am committed to continuing my learning and improving my skills to successfully complete similar tasks in the future.
